\chapter{Abstract}

Not too long ago it was incredible to carry in our pocket a tool that would allow us to know our
exact location. It was much less credible to imagine that this tool would give us the ability to be
always connected to the Internet. However, today that tool exists and is called a \emph{smartphone}.

With the recent popularity of smartphones have come a long series of \emph{wearables} accessories
that communicate with \emph{smartphones} and provide a new form of interaction with the device.

In this project shows one of the most important problems related to the use of \emph{smartphones}
for navigation by satellite: ease of cause a distraction and many times an accident. To solve this
problem, it is proposed a new form of interaction in which the system is responsible for alert the
user when you have to perform some action through \emph{wearables}. In this way we avoid the user to
have to look at the screen and will prevent this type of accident.

The application developed throughout the project is called \emph{Naviganto} and offers the user the
possibility to surf via satellite guided by the vibrations of two devices: one placed on the left
side of the body and the other located on the right side of it. In addition, \emph{Naviganto}
provides the user with common interactions of navigation applications such as the screen or the
sound.
